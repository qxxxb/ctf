## Overview

All we have to do is guess the output of Python's `random.random()` function.
The more accurate our guess is, the more points we get. We get the flag after
`10 ** 6` points.

```python
import random
from secret import flag
from fractions import Fraction


def score(a, b):
    if abs(a - b) < 1 / 2 ** 10:
        # capping score to 1024 so you dont get extra lucky
        return Fraction(2 ** 10)
    return Fraction(2 ** 53, int(2 ** 53 * a) - int(2 ** 53 * b))


total_score = 0
for _ in range(2000):
    try:
        x = random.random()
        y = float(input("enter your guess:\n"))
        round_score = score(x, y)
        total_score += float(round_score)
        print("total score: {:0.2f}, round score: {}".format(total_score, round_score))
        if total_score > 10 ** 6:
            print(flag)
            exit(0)
    except:
        print("Error, exiting")
        exit(1)
else:
    print("Maybe better luck next time")
```

## Solution

It's well-known that after 624 outputs from a Mersenne Twister, we can deduce
its seed and predict any future outputs.

So our goal is:

1. Extract the actual bits that the MT outputs from the `round_score`, which is
  a `Fraction`
2. Solve for the seed
3. Predict future outputs and get the flag

### Part 1: Extracting the bits

> Solved with @vishiswoz, who helped me sort out a bunch of mistakes in my code

```c
/*
 *...
 * In effect, `a` contains 27 random bits shifted left 26, and `b` fills in the
 * lower 26 bits of the 53-bit numerator.
 */
static PyObject *
_random_Random_random_impl(RandomObject *self)
/*[clinic end generated code: output=117ff99ee53d755c input=afb2a59cbbb00349]*/
{
    uint32_t a=genrand_uint32(self)>>5, b=genrand_uint32(self)>>6;
    return PyFloat_FromDouble((a*67108864.0+b)*(1.0/9007199254740992.0));
}
```

We can recover `a` and `b` just by shifting the bits:

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <assert.h>

int main()
{
  uint32_t a = 446374322 >> 5;
  uint32_t b = 2269612274 >> 6;
  double x = (a * 67108864.0 + b) * (1.0 / 9007199254740992.0);

  // We only know x. Goal is to recover a and b.
  // Note: 9007199254740992 == 2 ** 53
  // Note: 67108864 == 2 ** 26
  uint64_t y = (uint64_t)(x * 9007199254740992.0);
  assert(((uint64_t)a * 67108864 + b) == y);

  uint32_t a_recovered = y >> 26;
  uint32_t b_recovered = y & 0x3ffffff; // y % (2 ** 26)
  assert(a == a_recovered);
  assert(b == b_recovered);

  return 0;
}
```

## Part 2: Solving for the seed

Now that we have the exact bits generated from the Mersenne Twister, we
can give it to a Z3 solver to deduce the internal state.

I used this, which was well-written and easy to use:
https://github.com/icemonster/symbolic_mersenne_cracker/

It was also designed to handle truncated outputs, which was exactly what we
needed:
```python
ut = Untwister()

a, b = get_a_b_str(x)
assert len(a) == 32
assert len(b) == 32

# Just send stuff like "?11????0011?0110??01110????01???"
# Where ? represents unknown bits
ut.submit(a)
ut.submit(b)
```

## Part 3: Putting it together

After some testing, my script was able to solve the challenge locally in about
10 seconds. Sometimes it would give `z3.z3types.Z3Exception: model is not
available` for some reason, but I just re-ran it until it worked.

Unfortunately, running it remotely would take 20 minutes due to my slow network
connection. I could rent a VPS in India to send requests faster, but instead I
just modified my script to send inputs and parse outputs in bulk.

Output (solve script in `solve.py`)
